# Substitution-Cipher-Attack

This repository contains an implementation of the Substitution Cipher in Python alongside a statistical approach for decrypting it. 

Substitution ciphers encrypt the plaintext by swapping each letter in the plaintext with a different symbol as directed by the key. In the statistical decryption approach, we try to guess the key of the cipher by mapping each letter in the ciphertext to its plaintext counterpart based on letter frequency

The pdf files of the following books were used in this project:

- Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (used to find letter frequencies and distribution)
- Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (used as a ciphertext to be decoded) 

These files are NOT included in this repository.
